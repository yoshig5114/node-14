# 🏗️ Create an Algorithm Using Conditional Statements

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to write an algorithm that will take in two expressions and evaluate whether both expressions evaluate to `true`, only one expression evaluates to `true`, or both expressions evaluate to `false`.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the message "True ✅ True ✅" is logged when both `expression1` and `expression2` are true.
if (expression1 && expression2) console.log("True ✅ True ✅")
* It's done when the message "True ✅ False ❌" is logged when `expression1` is true. 
else if (expression1) console.log("True")
* It's done when the message "False ❌ True ✅" is logged when `expression2` is true. 
else if (expression2) "False ❌ True ✅"
* It's done when the message "False ❌ False ❌" is logged when both `expression1` and `expression2` are false. 
else console.log(False ❌ False ❌)
## 💡 Hints

Before you start writing your algorithm, do you have a plan documented in plain language that describes how you will use JavaScript to get it done?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What is a switch case?
